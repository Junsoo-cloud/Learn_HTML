 - Introduction to HTML (learn <body>/<body>)


1. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.

2. Most HTML elements contain opening <> and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them. /<>

3. HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.

4. Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing <body> tags.

5. Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to provide titles for sections of content.

6. <p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.

-> <p> & <div> tags are Block but <span> tag is Inline 
-> <span> tag target a specific piece
-> <div> can nest all but <p> don't
-> <div> represent HTML Area <-> <p> just Text

7. The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.

-> <em> : Italic / <strong> : Bold

8. Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.

-> it doesen't need closing tag also

9. Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.

-> <o1> : 1. 2. ... include index <-> <ul> : have bullet

10. Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing source.

-> <img src = "the imageâ€™s source, or the location of the image" alt = "Information of the image" />
-> <img> tag also doesn't need closing tag but /> 
-> src attribute is source, location / alt attribute is information of the image , also play as a role in Search Engine Optimization (SEO) -> can search imformation

-> <video> tag also has src but also has "width and height"
-> The controls attribute instructs the browser to include basic video controls such as pausing and playing.
-> if the browser is unable to load the video -> Video not supportde <- can use between video tags
